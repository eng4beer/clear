### Clear Linux Github Provisioning

This is a functional repo to demonstrate how to setup a webserver to function as a meta-data service. 
In this repo you will find some templates to build out a Clear Linux instance. 

You can use a standard web server to dynamically provision Clear Linux, in this case I am using Git Hub to service requests.
